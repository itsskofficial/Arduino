## About The Project

![Smart Dustbin](smart-dustbin.png)

The Smart Dustbin project leverages Arduino to create an intelligent waste disposal system. The dustbin senses motion in front of it and opens only when motion is detected. After waste is thrown in, the dustbin automatically closes, providing a hands-free and efficient waste disposal solution.

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://arduino.cc)

## Components Used

* Arduino Board
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Servo Motor
* Power Supply
* Connecting Wires

## Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](circuit-diagram.png)

The circuit involves connecting the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to the Arduino board as per the circuit diagram. This configuration enables the motion-sensing and automatic lid-opening functionality.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your Smart Dustbin locally. To get it up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Arduino IDE:**
  
  Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed.

  ```sh
  # To install Arduino IDE, visit: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software


### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/Arduino.git
    ```

2. **Enter into the directory**
    ```sh
    cd Projects/SmartDustbin
    ```

3. **Open the sketch**

    Open the smart_dustbin.ino file in the Arduino IDE.

4. **Upload the sketch**

   Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

The Smart Dustbin provides a convenient and hygienic waste disposal solution. It senses motion, opens the lid when necessary, and automatically closes after waste disposal, ensuring a hands-free experience.
